# Go Practice Examples

Welcome to my collection of Go (Golang) examples!  
This repository is intended as a personal space for learning and experimenting with the Go programming language.

## 📚 About

Here you'll find small, self-contained Go programs covering various concepts such as:

- Basic syntax
- Functions and methods
- Structs and interfaces
- Goroutines and channels (concurrency)
- File I/O
- Error handling
- Standard library utilities
- Mini projects and challenges

Feel free to explore, run, and modify any example to deepen your understanding.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run an example:

1. Make sure you have Go installed. You can download it from: [https://golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl)
2. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-practice-examples.git

    ```

3. Navigate to the folder of the example you want to run.

4. Run it using this:
